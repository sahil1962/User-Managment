# User-Managment
This project is a simple User Management System built using React for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend.

This project is a simple User Management System built using React for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend. Its main features include:

Adding Users: Users can be added to the system by entering their name, email, and role through a form. Email validation ensures the correct format is used.

Listing Users: The application displays a list of users, including their name, email, and role. Users are fetched from the backend and displayed dynamically.

Deleting Users: Users can be removed from the system by clicking the "Delete" button associated with each user. This action is handled through an API call to the backend, deleting the selected user from the stored data.

This application demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing users in a simple interface.
